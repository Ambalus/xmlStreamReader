      <title>Rules of cyberwar: don't target nuclear plants or hospitals, says Nato manual</title>

It also states that so-called hacktivists who participate in online attacks during a war can be legitimate targets even though they are civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group of experts was invited to draw up the handbook by Nato's &lt;a href="https://www.ccdcoe.org/" title=""&gt;Co-operative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence&lt;/a&gt; (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. The project took three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centre was established in 2008 following a wave of cyber-attacks on the Baltic state from inside Russia. The denial of service attacks crashed websites and damaged Estonia's infrastructure, raising awareness about the damage that online operations can inflict in an increasingly computer-dependent era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January David Cameron announced that the UK would be joining the CCDCOE this year. The UK ambassador to Tallinn, Chris Holtby, said then: "The UK will send an expert as well as continue the wider co-operation between the UK and the centre which already exists. The UK values strongly the work of the centre and looks forward to increasing our contribution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ccdcoe.org/405.html" title=""&gt;Tallinn manual&lt;/a&gt;, which contains 95 "black letter rules", was formally launched at the London thinktank Chatham House last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonel Kirby Abbott, an assistant legal adviser at Nato, said at the launch that the manual was now "the most important document in the law of cyberwarfare. It will be highly useful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx" title=""&gt;Professor Michael Schmitt&lt;/a&gt;, director of the project, who works at the US Naval War College, said there was relatively little consensus about how existing legal regimes governed online activities. The Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear programme, which physically damaged sensitive centrifuges, divided opinion among experts in the Tallinn group as to whether it constituted an armed conflict. The computer worm is widely believed to have been created by the US and/or Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule 22 of the handbook states: "An international armed conflict exists whenever there are hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations occurring between two states or more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attached commentary adds: "To date, no international armed conflict has been publicly characterised as having been solely precipitated in cyberspace. Nevertheless, the international group of experts unanimously concluded that cyber operations alone might have the potential to cross the threshold of international armed conflict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manual suggests "proportionate counter-measures" against online attacks carried out by a state are permitted. Such measures cannot involve the use of force, however, unless the original cyber-attack resulted in death or significant damage to property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formulating a framework for permitted counter-measures should not lower the threshold for future conflicts, Schmitt told the Guardian. "You can only use force when you reach the level of armed conflict. Everyone talks about cyberspace as though it's the wild west. We discovered that there's plenty of law that applies to cyberspace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often difficult to locate the source of an online attack. Publicity last month about a tower block in Shanghai said to contain a Chinese army unit and to be the source of numerous global cyber-attacks highlighted the difficulty of proving who is responsible for causing damage to computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule seven of the manual declares that if a cyber operation originates from a government network, "it is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that state but is an indication that the state in question is associated with the operation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The handbooks says that in accordance with Geneva conventions, attacks on certain key civilian sites are outlawed. Rule 80 of the handbooks states: "In order to avoid the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population, particular care must be taken during cyber-attacks against works an installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, as well as installations located in their vicinity." Hospitals and medical units are also protected as they would be under rules governing traditional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The handbook is not official Nato document or policy but an advisory manual. It is published by Cambridge University Press. A retired UK air commodore and several British lawyers were among those who worked on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 the UK's national security strategy characterised cyber-attacks, including those by other states, as &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/oct/18/national-security-strategy-cyber-attacks" title=""&gt;one of four "tier one" threats&lt;/a&gt; alongside terrorism, military crises between states and major accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nato"&gt;Nato&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/cybercrime"&gt;Cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owenbowcott"&gt;Owen Bowcott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He had faced a maximum of five years in prison for each charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/10/apple-ipad-security-leak" title=""&gt;The hack&lt;/a&gt;, carried out in June 2010 just two months after the iPad went on sale, exposed details of the then White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, as well as chief executives and military officials. Only email addresses were exposed. The exploit used the fact that AT&amp;T had allocated sim cards for 3G-enabled iPads with successive numbers and no security checks to prevent anyone accessing the details. A printout of the details was then sent to the &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/" title=""&gt;Gawker website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night before his sentencing, Auernheimer took part in a &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ahkgc/i_am_weev_i_may_be_going_to_prison_under_the/" title=""&gt;Reddit "Ask Me Anything" session&lt;/a&gt;. There he explained how he had carried out the hack: "In June of 2010 there was a public AT&amp;T webserver that had a URL for a public API with a number at the end of it. If you added one to this number you might see the next iPad 3G user email address. I aggregated a sample of this data and sent it to a journalist. I contend that I as an American have the right to profit from accessing a public webserver, adding one to a number and embarrassing a large corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite an email from AT&amp;T stating the data was 'published', 'no security was bypassed' and 'I don't think they [the feds] have a case', the feds [federal prosecutors] disagreed. In November of 2012 I was found guilty of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the same law used against Matthew Keys, Aaron Swartz and Stephen Watt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the courthouse steps before his sentencing, Auernheimer said: "I'm going to jail for doing arithmetic".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In describing the sentence, federal prosecutors referred three times to Auernheimer's Reddit AMA session, &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ahkgc/i_am_weev_i_may_be_going_to_prison_under_the/c8xgqq9" title=""&gt;in one part of which he said:&lt;/a&gt; "My regret is being nice enough to give AT&amp;T a chance to patch [the flaw] before dropping the dataset to Gawker. I won't nearly be as nice [sic] next time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of his sentencing on Monday, Auernheimer had been bullish: "No matter what the outcome, I will not be broken," &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rabite/status/313658826387779585" title=""&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. "I am antifragile," he added – a reference to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/dec/16/antifragile-nassim-nicholas-taleb-review" title=""&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt; by the economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb about systems that are robust enough to cope with disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two were &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jan/18/ipad-hacking-security-breach-us" title=""&gt;charged in January 2011&lt;/a&gt;. Their security company – which was also sometimes described as a hacker group – had previously pointed out flaws in the Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spitler took a plea bargain in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/hacking"&gt;Hacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipad"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/email"&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing"&gt;Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/tablet-computer"&gt;Tablet computers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur"&gt;Charles Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Heathrow Express offers it free to all passengers, while the Gatwick Express has no service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cash will be used to install special equipment on trains, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone signals are more likely to bounce off trains than into them, but connections can be improved by fixing antennae to carriage roofs which replicate signals through repeaters in the train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virgin Trains installed repeaters on its Voyager services in north Wales and on cross country routes through a contract with Orange, and teamed up with Vodafone in 2008 to bring the technology to its high-speed Pendolino trains between London and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of franchises offer free Wi-Fi to all passengers, but most charge those travelling second class while giving the service free to first-class passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people resent having to listen to loud phone calls, internet connections are less disruptive and popular with passengers. National Express registered a threefold increase in passengers along the east coast line after offering free Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line was previously operated by Great North Eastern Railway, which charged £4.95 an hour for the service. When National Express removed the charge in January 2008, passenger rates rose from 30,000 to 100,000 for the month, with regulators saying part of the increase was due to free Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virgin Media said it wants half of the government's £150m Urban Broadband fund, designed to improve internet infrastructure in cities, to be diverted to skills and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BT and Virgin Media are concerned public money could be used to build networks which compete with their own. They have launched legal action against a European commission decision to let Birmingham city council spend £10m from the Urban Broadband fund on installing fibre-optic cables in areas where they already serve customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Berkett, chief executive of Virgin Media, has written to the chancellor, George Osborne, suggesting half of the fund be spent improving digital skills for small and medium sized businesses – only two-thirds have a website and just a third sell goods and services online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/rail-transport"&gt;Rail transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/wifi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/virginrail"&gt;Virgin Rail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliette-garside"&gt;Juliette Garside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Ellen Ullman: the computer programmer who became a novelist</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/18/ellen-ullman-computer-programmer-novelist</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.3/35597?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=GUK%3AArticle%3Aellen-ullman-computer-programmer-novelist%3A1882139&amp;ch=Life+and+style&amp;c3=G2&amp;c4=Women+and+women%27s+interests%2CBooks%2CCulture%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CLife+and+style&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CWomen%2CCorporate+IT&amp;c6=Emine+Saner&amp;c7=2013%2F03%2F18+06%3A58&amp;c8=1882139&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Interview%2CFeature&amp;c13=&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c47=UK&amp;c65=Ellen+Ullman%3A+the+computer+programmer+who+became+a+novelist&amp;c66=Life+and+style&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FLife+and+style%2FLife+and+style%2FWomen" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Ellen Ullman uses her experience as a successful computer programmer to write books. She talks about sexism in the tech industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellen Ullman's first computer was a Radio Shack TRS-80, a squat little machine with a chunky cassette deck for the data on which she taught herself how to program. It was the 1970s and Ullman, who had just moved to San Francisco, found herself in the middle of the nascent Silicon Valley – a place so desperate for anyone who knew anything about computers that they were throwing job offers around, even at a self-taught programmer with an English degree. Even at a woman?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing Ullman puts me right on, when we sit down in a cafe near her hotel in central London, is that there were quite a few other women working in the tech industry then, just not many in programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not? "I think because of the stereotype – that it's mathematics. Typically women were steered away from that. I was steered into English, though I'm absolutely happy to have studied that. I think technical people now should learn literature, because literature teaches you a great deal about how the depths and variety of&amp;nbsp;human imagination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She experienced a great deal of sexism, from being mistaken for a secretary when she was running a project, to salesmen for the companies she worked for being disappointed when she turned up in a trouser suit to meet clients (they expected her to look "sexy"). She would be "daring", as she puts it, when asking for the right level of pay. "I would say: 'If you want to keep me after two months, this is what you have to pay.' I had to have a confidence. When I did consulting occasionally it was a barrier to be taken seriously as a technical person. It is to this day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, she thinks, the sexism in the tech industry is getting worse. "There are very few women writing apps, and venture capitalists will say openly, 'I want to hire a couple of guys who can come up with an app over spring break,' and it's always a couple of 'guys'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her first book, Close to the Machine, was published in 1997 Ullman started to write more. The book, a "cult classic", was one of the first to really convey the appeal of code. But it's a curious mix – alongside the clear passion for the problem solving and possibilities is Ullman's unease at how much it could change our lives. She would build programmes for clients, who would then ask her how they could keep track of their employees' keystrokes, or databases that would also give government agencies access to private health information. Even just the way computers would inveigle their way into our everyday lives. "I have this idea that we programmers are the world's canaries," she writes. "We spend our time alone in front of monitors; now look up at any office building, look into living-room windows at night: so many people sitting alone in front of monitors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, it was a lover, Brian, who described the people who would really become rich, "And it would not be the 'content makers' – the artists, writers, multimedia makers … the ones making the money would be the owners of the transaction itself. The new breed of entrepreneur: net landlord. Content is worthless, art is just an excuse to get someone to click."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ullman's first novel, The Bug, was obviously influenced by her 20-year career as a programmer, but her latest, By Blood, is a firm step away, despite being set in the 1970s. Based on conversations between a therapist and her patient – a woman who is trying to track down her birth mother – it is a book about identity and is inspired, in part, by Ullman's own history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was adopted when she was six months old – all she knows of her birth mother was that she was "a pretty Jewish lady" – and grew up in a wealthy family in New York. After studying English at Cornell University, she moved to San Francisco and found herself not only in the boom of computing, but also in the midst of radical feminism (she was already deeply political, having briefly joined the Communist party). She was, for a while, involved in the lesbian separatist movement (she was in a long-term relationship with a woman) and remembers a "women-only coffee shop and library" with a smile. "We mostly lived in the Mission district and there was She remembers feeling detached from huge billboards of adverts featuring women in high heels. "I just stopped seeing them. I had this idea 'this doesn't apply to me' and it was a way to detach from the pressure of how a woman is supposed to look or be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even then, the people she worked with were more political than the young men who appear to populate startups now, she says. The stereotype of the programmer – nerdy, socially-awkward – certainly existed, "but people I knew at that time were wild, outside the mainstream". Now, "this group are all in business casual. Riding bicycles, terribly healthy. It's just awful." She laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, did they have any idea what sort of future the technology they were working on would bring? "No. [We were] imagining something and then seeing what would work. There were tremendous limitations with the hardware and software so it was a&amp;nbsp;step-by-step thing. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get the sense she is a little disappointed with some of what has happened. Ullman seems astonished that there isn't a mass general protest at threats to privacy, and she doesn't use Twitter, for instance. "This idea that everything should be tailored to you, that you should broadcast your every thought. And the self-promotion that everyone has to do. I think it's required in some way because this is the way ideas get disseminated, but the idea that each person has to be their own marketer, that's a different scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ullman is already working on her next book, which will see a return to technology. "I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you the working title, but it's We Are All Programmers Now. That idea that it went from this tiny group of people who knew what was going on to, I think, you, who have an idea how to do a little tinkering through your webpage, or dealing with your phone settings. I think, to&amp;nbsp;that extent, everyone is becoming a&amp;nbsp;programmer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing"&gt;Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/eminesaner"&gt;Emine Saner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Did Russian hackers' reveal a soft spot for the Soviet Union with .su suffix?</title>

But "owners of '.su' sites stubbornly resisted switching, on commercial, political and patriotic grounds", &lt;a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/products/2008-04-18-196687842_x.htm"&gt;according to this USA Today story from 2008&lt;/a&gt;. The fledgling RIPN was forced to compromise and agreed to stop issuing new .su sites, while existing ones were allowed to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2012, &lt;a href="www.abuse.ch"&gt;abuse.ch&lt;/a&gt;, a Swiss cybersecurity blog, noted that increasing numbers of 'domain hacks' – ie unusual uses of a ccTLD – were popping up with the .su suffix, namely by hackers. This was to get around a 2011 crackdown by RIPN which began systematically shutting down suspected hacking sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But .su is not the only curious nation-state domain name:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.ly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya's suffix proved to be popular before the Arab uprising that ousted Gaddaffi, because it was comparatively cheap. URL shortener Bitly started the .ly domain hack trend by registering bit.ly; inspiring others like brief.ly, adf.ly and ow.ly to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Libyan domain name governing body (nic.ly) has very strict regulations, namely: "Domain names must not contain obscene, scandalous, indecent, or contrary to Libyan law or islamic morality words, phrases nor abbreviations." This policy has resulted in websites being shut down, such as Vb.ly a "sex-positive URL shortener," &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/06/vbly-domain-seizure/"&gt;seized by the Libyan government in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.aq&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Antartica has no permanent human residents, it does have a ccTLD. This is available to government organizations who are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty or others who have a physical presence south of latitude 60ºS. The Vatican also has its own ccTLD, .va, to serve its 832 residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.am, .fm and .tv&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;.am is the official ccTLD for Armenia, but AM radio stations have encroached on this domain. According to Armenia's Network Information Chapter, the local regulating body for .am domains, an .am suffix can be acquired for a mere $29.01 a year. Creative domain hacks have also been used by companies such as Instagram, which owns own instagr.am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.fm is the Federated States of Micronesia's official suffix. But the domain is popular and clearly valuable to FM radio stations. Anyone can purchase an .fm suffix, for an annual fee – proceeds of which apparently go to the government and people of micronesia – though calls to Micronesia's IANA representative went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Polynesian island of Tuvalu, home to fewer than 11,000 people, was granted .tv. But given the suffix's popularity with television companies, it is in far wider use than the size of its population might suggest. The suffix. .tv was bought by American company Verisign in 2000, with Tuvalu retaining a 20% stake. Tuvalu signed a 12-year leasing contract for .tv for a $50m payout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.eh&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ccTLD has been the subject of a power struggle between Morocco and Western Sahara, a disputed territory. Both have laid claims to the domain, but the IANA has ruled to keep the domain inactive until "the two contesting applicants work together to find a mutual solution that will serve the needs of the local Internet community in the best possible fashion". An unlikely scenario, given the two parties have been fighting since Spain released Western Sahara as a colony in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.yu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suffixes of countries that disappear from the map usually just expire. Yugoslavia's .yu was in use until 2010, but was ultimately retired when both Serbia and Montenegro were granted new domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Czechoslovakia's .cs, expired in 1993, leaving Slovakia to adopt .sk and the Czech Republic .cs. Zaire's .zr morphed into .cd for the Democratic Republic of Congo – not to be confused with .cg, for Congo-Brazzaville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for Netherlands Antilles, a Caribbean island and former constituent country of the Netherlands. Despite the country's recent dissolution, the .an suffix has been retained. East Germany put forth .dd, but reunification got in the way before that ever came to be in use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.рф&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two domain suffixes apparently aren't enough for Russia. In 2009, they were granted their own Cyrillic script ccTLD. Only 21 other countries have alternative ccTLDs using letters in their country's native script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.la, .lv, and .to&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laos, Latvia and the Tonga are repeatedly domain hacked by North American cities, eager to stake a claim on the internet. Los Angeles businesses are attempting to reappropriate Laos's .la; Las Vegas courts Latvia's .lv and Tonga's .to finds itself affiliated with Toronto, Turin and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;.cx&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christmas Island, home to approximately 2,072 residents, has its own .cx domain suffix. This gained brief notoriety during the high-profile murder trial of Joji Obara, a Japanese man jailed for the rape and murder of British woman Lucie Blackman. During the trial, a mysterious website appeared with a .cx suffix, seemingly in support of Obara. The website detailed Obara's version of events, extracts from Blackman's diary, a selection from court transcripts as well as court documents signed by several key members of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it was forbidden to publish documents such as these without the court's permission while the case was active, those responsible for the site understood that hosting the site through Christmas Island guaranteed a lengthy legal process if prosecutors wanted to shut it down. Incidentally, no criminal case was ever mounted, according to Richard Loyd Parry in his book on the case, People Who Eat Darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/hacking"&gt;Hacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/raya-jalabi"&gt;Raya Jalabi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

And you might even know of Vint Cerf, who in the 1970s along with Robert (Bob) Kahn devised the internet protocol that lets everything from emails to real-time video travel over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about Louis Pouzin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the other four, Pouzin was honoured on Monday as one of five winners of the first £1m Queen Elizabeth prize for engineering, for their "seminal contributions to the protocols (or standards) that together make up the fundamental architecture of the internet".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pouzin, 82, from Nievre in France, is in fact an influencer who came before all the others: he developed an early communications network that used "packets" of data (meaning it did not require a constant connection between sender and receiver) which then influenced Cerf and Kahn, who developed the protocols for the internet, upon which Berners-Lee built the world wide web, which could be navigated via Andreessen's Mosaic browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accepting the shared prize, Cerf said: "This is like waking up from a really exciting dream and discovering the geeks are winning!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the prize would mean that "finally, engineering is taking as visible a place as the Nobel prizes give to other fields such as science. It's particularly appropriate that the UK is taking this step – maybe it will become as significant as Sweden has become with the Nobel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://qeprize.org/judges/" title=""&gt;15-strong judging team&lt;/a&gt;, which included the physicist Brian Cox and former engineering chief Lord Alec Broers, was looking for "a person or up to three people who is (or who are) personally and indisputably responsible for a ground-breaking innovation in engineering, of demonstrable global benefit to humanity".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges said: "Today a third of the world's 7 billion population use the internet, and estimates are that it carries 330 Petabytes of data per year. This is enough to transfer every character ever written in every book ever published 20 times over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: "The internet and world wide web initiated a communications revolution which has changed the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nominations for the prize, which has funding from a number of companies, opened in February 2012 and closed in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cox said: "My dream scenario is that every time someone logs on to the internet and gets something – say just a little piece of information – that they associate that with engineers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/engineering"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/timbernerslee"&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur"&gt;Charles Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Some facilities will be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 100 British jobs at the Connectivity Solutions side of the business are affected, but a spokesperson was unable to say whether they will be absorbed back into one of the partners. The move may also affect 27 jobs in Daventry, Northamptonshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STMicro shares rose about 5% after the news. Ericsson shares were up 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STMicro will keep making products for ST-Ericsson customers who want them, Bozotti said. Among those using its chips besides Nokia is Samsung, which has four phones -– though none of its flagships -– using them. The joint venture has looked vulnerable for months, with STMicro warning in December that it would pull out because the business was losing market share and showed no signs of breaking even. In January management warned of a "significant sequential decline" in sales during this first quarter because of the decline in smartphone shipments running the Symbian software from Nokia. Total sales in 2012 fell 19% to $1.35bn (£1.16bn), while losses eased slightly to $749m from $841m in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total revenues had fallen every year from 2009, while losses widened. In all the company generated $7.82bn in revenue and lost $2.72bn from the first quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is reckoned to have comprised about 30% of ST-Ericsson's sales, but the Symbian line is now effectively dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson will take back about 1,800 of the staff, and will keep a loss-making business making a 4G chip used in smartphones. That is expected to lose about 500m Swedish krona (£52m) in the latest quarter, due to R&amp;D costs, but Ericsson chief executive Hans Vestberg said it aimed to make the product line a top-three global player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We obviously have the ambition of making this profitable … and with a slimmer organisation I believe we have a much greater chance of getting there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts were sceptical. "I doubt that unit will be profitable," a Stockholm-based analyst who declined to be named told the Reuters news agency. "My understanding is that it has no sales today and just one design win. Either it is a success or it is not, and then you are stuck with all the losses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STMicro will keep a number of ST-Ericsson products, as well as certain assembly and test facilities. It will take about 950 employees, mostly in France and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest will be shut down, losing between 500 and 700 jobs in Europe, with 400-600 in Sweden and 50-80 in Germany. No factories will be closed, STMicro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STMicro expects the closures and restructuring to cost $350m to $450m, less than the $500m it predicted at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson made a provision of 3.3bn Swedish krona in 2012 to pay for the moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/smartphones"&gt;Smartphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones"&gt;Mobile phones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/samsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/nokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/manufacturing-sector"&gt;Manufacturing sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/symbian"&gt;Symbian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur"&gt;Charles Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>UK games industry is growing says trade body</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/18/uk-games-industry-growth</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.3/41226?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=GUK%3AArticle%3Auk-games-industry-growth%3A1881756&amp;ch=Technology&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Games+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CPC+%28games%29%2CSmartphones%2CApple+%28Technology%29%2CMobile+%28Games%29%2CAndroid+%28technology%29%2CXbox%2CPlayStation+%28Technology%29&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CTechnology+Gadgets%2CGames&amp;c6=Keith+Stuart&amp;c7=2013%2F03%2F18+03%3A59&amp;c8=1881756&amp;c9=Blog&amp;c10=Blogpost%2CNews&amp;c13=&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c25=Games+blog&amp;c47=UK&amp;c65=UK+games+industry+is+growing+says+trade+body&amp;c66=News&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FNews%2FTechnology%2FGames" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;A new report from trade association Tiga suggests that the British games industry is in growth after three years of decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years of decline, the UK games industry has bucked economic trends and entered a period of growth according to a new report from trade body, &lt;a href="http://www.tiga.org/"&gt;Tiga&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a survey of developers conducted by Games Investor Consulting, the sector grew by four per cent in 2012, with the number of development studios rising from 329 to 448 between 2011 and 2012. The number of creative staff working directly on game development has increased as well, from 8,888 to 9,224. Tiga has calculated that the industry's annual contribution to UK Gross Domestic Product is now £947m, up from £912m two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The increasing prevalence of mobile and tablet devices have created a growing market for games: studios are setting up to meet this demand," said Tiga CEO Richard Wilson. "The closure of big console-based studios has been followed by an explosion of small start-up companies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson also believes that the government's decision to provide the sector with creative industry tax breaks is already having a positive effect on inward investment, despite the fact that developers are unable to apply until next month. Since the announcement, Activision Blizzard has founded a mobile studio, The Blast Furnace, in Leeds, while Japanese social gaming giant Gree has opened a UK office. Furthermore, Konami has set up PES Productions in London to work on its long-running football series, and Microsoft has started the digital-only studio Lift in London. "Jobs and investment in the games industry are set grow further once Games Tax Relief comes into effect from April 2013," said Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the University of Abertay set up a prototype fund for start-up games studios, and director of business development Paul Durrant believes Tiga's findings are reflected in the level of interest he has received. "We've seen over 300 applications come in – not all of those are from different companies, but there has been a large number of studios applying to us. Out of those we've funded 63 so far. We've got an interesting situation where a lot very experienced staff who've worked for big name console developers have for various reasons gone into start ups and I'm sure that's swelling numbers. Many of those are chasing the Holy Grail of direct-to-consumer opportunities through social, mobile and casual games."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the British industry has seen a major shift in development behaviours as larger developers have closed, often spawning several smaller studios in their passing. When veteran Liverpool studio Bizarre Creations was shut by its publisher Activision in 2011, at least two studios – Hogrocket and Lucid Games – were formed by ex-staff: both of those started out with iOS projects. The closure of Black Rock in Brighton again spawned at least four new developers: Shortround Games, West Pier, Boss Alien and Roundcube, and again, a majority have concentrated on the iOS market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big question is over how sustainable the growth is if it is reliant on the smartphone sector. New studios going in to Apple and Android development are entering an incredibly competitive market, where hundreds of new game titles are released every week. Only a tiny percentage will ever see the sort of financial rewards enjoyed by developers of titles like Angry Birds and Temple Run. The Tiga report concedes that 21% of the UK studios started up in 2010 have since gone under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Arnot was the studio director at successful Dundee developer 4J Studios, before leaving last year to set up &lt;a href="http://www.stormcloudgames.com"&gt;Stormcloud Games&lt;/a&gt;. He recognises that, while the Tiga report is positive, it hints at an industry saturated with start-ups. "There are a lot of talented people deciding to get back to the simpler days of smaller teams and smaller projects," he says. "We're all vulnerable. Finding work-for-hire is a challenge because there are a lot of people doing great stuff. But we really wanted to explore our own IP and it's difficult to do that in the console space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stormcloud's answer has been to seek out an unconventional licensing arrangement. The company's first project is Paper Zoo, an iOS game in which players craft cute origami animals and then care for them. Through enterprise agency Scottish Development International, the team managed to get in touch with Japanese origami expert, Fumiaki Shingu, and will release the game as Mr Shingu's Paper Zoo, reflecting the hugely successful Nintendo title, Dr Kawashima's Brain Training. "His website has 10 million visitors a year - we hope that will give us a bit of traction to get us started," says Arnot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, game development graduates who go on to set up their own studios are finding the transition into a business environment difficult. "As a gamer, the Tiga report has made me happier," says Sophia George, the creative director at &lt;a href="http://www.swallowtailgames.com/"&gt;Swallowtail Games&lt;/a&gt;, which won a Bafta for its debut iOS title Tick Tock Toys. "It's great that we've had some growth in the UK, it might mean more ambitious projects. But as an indie it doesn't mean that much to me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm talking to investors now and it's terrifying. We're speaking to people about contract work, about studio space... it's all a bit up in the air. I've been at university for four years and it was really focused on creativity and innovation, but we didn't learn that much about business – it's all really new to me. I'm worried about taking loans – if I can't pay it back, I'm screwed. I've got to be so careful. I know a lot of young studios in the same situation and we're just not sure who to turn to for advice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Tiga and fellow trade body UKIE are looking to set up programmes to help small studios. "Our top priority is to assist developers and digital publishers to build sustainable businesses and so we intend to provide events and best practice information on these vital commercial skills," says Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in a crowded and highly competitive market, it's inevitable that many of these studios will fail. So is the optimism of Tiga's report misplaced? "I think there will be quite a lot of churn," says Durrant. "However, it's very similar to the classic innovation funnel: from a UK perspective, we need to have high numbers of start-ups to get a small number of successes. And if there are closures, I think that would be a temporary blip before those more successful studios began to grow and acquire staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But yes, there's a huge fragility to a lot of these companies - a shortage of working capital is prevalent and everything depends on getting some success with their first IP. Some of the teams coming into this sector from console development have lived in a very different world, where the publisher picks up the marketing tab. They're having to learn by the seat of their pants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tiga report, 'Making Games in the UK Today. A Census of the UK Developer and Digital Publishing Sector', is due to be published in March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/games"&gt;Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pc"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/smartphones"&gt;Smartphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobile"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/android"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/xbox"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/playstation"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/keithstuart"&gt;Keith Stuart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.3/12258?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=GUK%3AArticle%3Aapple-microsoft%3A1881856&amp;ch=Technology&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Apple+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CWorld+news%2CMicrosoft+%28Technology%29%2CSamsung+%28Technology%29&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CTechnology+Gadgets%2CCorporate+IT&amp;c6=Jean-Louis+Gass%C3%A9e&amp;c7=2013%2F03%2F18+02%3A47&amp;c8=1881856&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Blogpost%2CComment%2CNews&amp;c13=Monday+Note+%28series%29&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c47=UK&amp;c65=Apple+is+losing+the+war+%E2%80%93+of+words&amp;c66=News&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FNews%2FTechnology%2FApple" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Besides its ads, Apple says very little, confident numbers will do the talking. This no longer works as others have seized the opportunity to drive the narrative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The day before Samsung's big Galaxy S4 announcement,&lt;/strong&gt; Apple's vice-president of marketing, Phil Schiller, sat down for an &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-apple-schiller-idUSBRE92C1FQ20130314"&gt;interview with Reuters&lt;/a&gt; and promptly committed what Daring Fireball's John Gruber calls an &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/14/unforced-error"&gt;&lt;em&gt;unforced error&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"… the news we are hearing this week [is] that the Samsung Galaxy S4 is being rumored to ship with an OS that is nearly a year old," [Schiller] said, "Customers will have to wait to get an update."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so, as Gruber quickly corrects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it ends up the S4 is – to Samsung's credit – &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-galaxy-s-iv-36261"&gt;&lt;em&gt;shipping with Android 4.2.2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the latest available version. Not sure why Schiller would speculate on something like this based solely on rumours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Samsung's delight, we can be sure, the interview received wide coverage&lt;/strong&gt; in publications such as the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324077704578358760931327672.html"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-13/apple-s-schiller-takes-aim-at-samsung-on-eve-of-galaxy-unveiling.html"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, just hours before the S4 was unveiled, complete with the &lt;em&gt;month&lt;/em&gt;-old Android operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This didn't go over well. Even before the "year old Android version" was exposed as unfounded conjecture, reactions to Schiller's trash talk were uniformly negative. Apple was accused of being on the defensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the true believers ask, isn't this something of a double-standard? What about the trash-talk Samsung ads that depicted the iPhone as old-fashioned and its users as either cult sheep or doddering golden agers, weren't they also a form of defensiveness? Why were Samsung's mean-spirited ads seen as fun and creative, while Schiller's slight mis-step is called "defensive"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, Apple is held to a (well-earned) different standard.&lt;/strong&gt; Once a challenger with an uncertain future, Apple has become &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man"&gt;The Man&lt;/a&gt;. Years ago, it could productively poke fun at Microsoft in the great &lt;em&gt;I'm a Mac, You're a PC &lt;/em&gt;campaign (the full series of ads is &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/apples-get-mac-complete-campaign-130552"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but the days of taking potshots at the incumbent are over. Because of its position at the top, Apple should have the grace to not trash its competitors, especially when the digs are humourless and further weakened by error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schiller's faux pas will soon be forgotten – it was a minor infraction, a five-yard penalty – but it stoked my enduring frustration with a different sort of Apple-speak characteristic: The way Apple execs abuse words such as &lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;incredible&lt;em&gt;", "&lt;/em&gt;great&lt;em&gt;", "&lt;/em&gt;best&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt; when they're discussing the company's products and business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My accusation of language molestation needs examples. Citing a page from W Edwards Deming's gospel, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming"&gt;In God We Trust, Everyone Else Brings Data&lt;/a&gt;, I downloaded a handful of Apple earnings calls, such as&lt;a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1129431-apple-s-ceo-discusses-f1q-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt; this one&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of Seeking Alpha, and began to dig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Speaking of language faux pas, Deming's saying was shamelessly and badly appropriated – without attribution – &lt;a href="http://singularityhub.com/2012/02/06/googles-eric-schmidt-on-collective-intelligence-%E2%80%9Cin-god-we-trust-but-all-others-bring-data%E2%80%9D/"&gt;by Google's Eric Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; in a talk at MIT.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking just for the words that emanated from the horses' mouths, I stripped the intros and outros and the question parts of the Q&amp;As, and pasted into Pages (which has, sadly, lain fallow since January 2009). Pages has a handy search function (in the Edit &amp; Find submenu) that compiles a list of all occurrences of a word in a document; here's what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Across the five earnings statements, some form of the word "incredible" appears 7, 9, 9, 11 and 9 times. The search function offers a handy snippet display so you can check the context in which the word was used:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Q2-F12-Incredible-Edited.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-5384" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Q2 F12 Incredible Edited" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Q2-F12-Incredible-Edited.png" alt="" width="454" height="218" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;"Tremendous", in its various forms, appears 12 times.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Amazing: 8&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Strong: 58&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Thrilled: 13&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maniacally focused: 2&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;All told, "great" appears 70 times. A bit more than half are pathetic superlatives ("great products", "great progress", "we feel great about …"), some are innocuous ("greater visibility"), but there's an interesting twist: The snippet display showed that six were part of the phrase "Greater China":&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Q1-FY-13-Great-Edited.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-5383" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Q1 FY 13 Great Edited" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Q1-FY-13-Great-Edited.png" alt="" width="464" height="383" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Greater" or not, China is mentioned 71 times, much more than any other country or region I checked (Korea = 1, Japan = 6, Europe = 12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(In the interest of warding off accusations of a near-obsessive waste of energy, I used a command line program to generate some of these numbers. Android? give me a second ... 4. Google = 0, Facebook = 4, Samsung = 2.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's try some "sad" words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Disappoint: 0&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Weak: 7. Six of these were part of "weak dollar"; the other was "weak PC market". By contrast, only five or six of the 58 "strongs" referred to the dollar; the rest were along the lines of "strong iPad sales".&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bad: 0&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fail: 0&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;iMap: 0&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dissection can go on and on, but let's end it with a comparison between &lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;more&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;less&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt; . Eliminating instances of &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; as a suffix ("wireless"), the result shows a remarkable unbalance: &lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;more&lt;em&gt;" &lt;/em&gt;wins each of the five sessions with a consistently lopsided score: 28 to 3 ... more or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, you'll object, what's wrong with being positive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing, but this isn't about optimism, it's about hyperbole and the abuse of language. Saying "incredible" too many times leads to incredulity. Saying "maniacally focused" &lt;em&gt;at all &lt;/em&gt;is out of place and gauche&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in an earnings call. One doesn't brag about one's performance in the boudoir; let happy partners sing your praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When words become empty, the listener loses faith in the speaker. Apple has lost control of the narrative; the company has let others define its story.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a war of words and Apple is proving to be inept at verbal warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another of his sharply worded analyses titled &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/03/ceding_the_crown"&gt;Ceding the Crown&lt;/a&gt;, John Gruber makes the same point, although from a different angle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The desire for the "Oh, how the mighty Apple has fallen" narrative is so strong that the narrative is simply being stated as fact, evidence to the contrary be damned. It's reported as true simply because they want it to be true. They're declaring "The king is dead; long live the king" not because the king has actually died or abdicated the throne, but because they're bored with the king and want to write a new coronation story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the perception, but blaming the media rarely produces results, we shouldn't point our criticism in the wrong direction. The media have their priorities, which more often than not veer in the direction of entertainment passed as fair and balanced information (see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_ourselves_to_death"&gt;Amusing Ourselves To Death&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman"&gt;Neil Postman&lt;/a&gt;). If Apple won't feed them an interesting, captivating story, they'll find it elsewhere, even in rumours and senseless hand-wringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacking competitors, pointing to their weaknesses, and trumpeting one's achievements is better done by hired media assassins. A company, directly or through a PR firm, engages oft-quoted consultants who provide the required third-party stats, barbs, and encomiums. This isn't theorising, I once was a director at a company, one of many, that used such an arrangement to good effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief anecdote: When Microsoft was Microsoft, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggener_Edstrom_Worldwide"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waggener Edstrom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the company's PR powerhouse, was an exemplary propagandist.&lt;/strong&gt; I distinctly remember a journalist from a white-shoe East Coast business publication coming to my office more than 20 years ago, asking very pointed questions. I asked my own questions in return and realised that the individual didn't quite know the meaning of certain terms that he was throwing around. A bit of hectoring and cajoling, and the individual finally admitted that the questions were talking points provided by the Seattle PR firm. A few years later, I got a comminatory phone call from one of the firm's founders. My offence? I had made an unflattering quip about Microsoft when it was having legal troubles with Apple (the IP battle that was later settled as part of the 1997 "&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-202143.html"&gt;investment&lt;/a&gt;" in Apple and Steve Jobs). PR firms have long memories and sharp knives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach may seem cynical, but it's convenient and effective. The PR firm maintains a net (and that's the right word) of relationships with the media and their pilot fish. If it has the talent of a Waggener Edstrom, it provides sound strategic advice, position papers, talking points, and freeze-dried one-liners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a PR firm has the power of providing &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt;. I once asked a journalist friend how his respected newspaper could have allowed one of its writers to publish a fallacious piece that described, in dulcet tones, a worldwide Microsoft R&amp;D tour by the company's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missus_dominicus"&gt;missus dominicus&lt;/a&gt;. "Access, Jean-Louis, access. That's the price you pay to get the next Ballmer interview…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, look at the truly admirable job &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fxshaw"&gt;Frank Shaw&lt;/a&gt; does for Microsoft. Always on Twitter, frequently writing learned and assertive pieces for the company's &lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/"&gt;official blog&lt;/a&gt;. By the way, where's Apple's blog?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The popular notion is that Apple rose to the top without these tools and tactics, but that's not entirely true.&lt;/strong&gt; Dear Leader was a one-man &lt;em&gt;propagandastaffel&lt;/em&gt;, maintaining his own small network of trusted friends in the media. Jobs also managed to get exemptions from good-behavior rules, exemptions that seem to have expired with him…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before leaving us, Jobs famously admonished "left-behind" Apple execs to think for themselves instead of trying to guess what he would have done. Perhaps it's time for senior execs to rethink the kind of control they want to exercise on what others say about Apple. Either stay the old course and try to let the numbers do the talking, or go out and really fight the war of words. Last week's misstep didn't belong to either approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last word: In the two trading days bracketing the Samsung S4 launch Schiller clumsily attempted to trash, Apple shares respectively gained 1%, followed by a 2.58% jump the day after the intro. Schiller could have said nothing before the launch and, today, let others point to &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/15/galaxy-s-iv-crapware/"&gt;early criticism&lt;/a&gt; of the S4's apparent &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featuritis"&gt;featuritis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:JLG@mondaynote.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JLG@mondaynote.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/samsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jean-louis-gassee"&gt;Jean-Louis Gassée&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Budget 2013 said to include Wi-Fi and mobile access on trains funding</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.3/40319?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=GUK%3AArticle%3Abudget-wi-fi-mobile-trains%3A1881786&amp;ch=Technology&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Wi-Fi%2CTelecoms+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CVirgin+Media%2CMedia+business%2CMedia%2CMobile+phones+%28Technology%29%2CTransport+policy%2CTransport+UK+news%2CPolitics%2CBudget+2013%2CBudget%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CPolicy+Society%2CMedia+Weekly%2CTechnology+Gadgets%2CCorporate+IT%2CBudget&amp;c6=Juliette+Garside&amp;c7=2013%2F03%2F18+02%3A07&amp;c8=1881786&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c13=&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c47=UK&amp;c65=Budget+2013+said+to+include+Wi-Fi+and+mobile+access+on+trains+funding&amp;c66=News&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FNews%2FTechnology%2FWi-Fi" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Chancellor expected to announce installation of special equipment on trains that could boost travel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for widespread Wi-Fi and mobile access on trains is expected to be among George Osborne's budget giveaways this week – and it could boost train travel as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers who prefer quiet carriages will have to grit their teeth: in a move intended to boost national productivity, the chancellor will offer help for commuters who want to use their train journeys to catch up on work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 25 rail franchise operators, 12 still do not have an onboard Wi-Fi service, according to the Association of Train Operating Companies website. For example, the Heathrow Express offers Wi-Fi free to all passengers, while the Gatwick Express has none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cash will be used to install special equipment on trains with no Wi-Fi service, according to industry sources. A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metal shell of train carriages tends to absorb mobile phone signals, but connections can be improved by fixing antennae to carriage roofs which receive outside signals from mobile masts and replicate them through a series of repeaters in the train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virgin Trains installed repeaters on its Voyager services in North Wales and on cross-country routes through a contract with Orange, and teamed up with Vodafone in 2008 to bring the technology to its high speed Pendolino trains between London and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of franchises offer free Wi-Fi to all passengers, but most charge those travelling in standard class while giving the service away to first class passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many travellers resent having to listen to loud one-sided phone calls, internet connections are less disruptive and popular with passengers. National Express registered a threefold increase along its East Coast Line after offering free Wi-Fi, having taken over the line previously operated by Great North Eastern Railway, which charged £4.95 per hour for the service. When National Express removed the charge in January 2008, the number of passengers using the line rose from 30,000 to 100,000 for the month: regulators said part of the increase was due to free Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More budget news ...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virgin Media wants half of the £150m government Urban Broadband fund for improving internet infrastructure in cities to be diverted to skills and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BT and Virgin Media are concerned public money could be used to build networks which compete with their own. They have launched legal action against a European Commission decision to let Birmingham City council spend £10m from the Urban Broadband fund on installing fibre-optic cables in areas where they already serve customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Berkett, chief executive of Virgin Media, has written to chancellor George Osborne suggesting half of the fund be spent improving digital skills for small and medium-sized businesses, where only two-thirds have a website and just a third sell goods and services online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/wifi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/telecoms"&gt;Telecoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/virginmedia"&gt;Virgin Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediabusiness"&gt;Media business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones"&gt;Mobile phones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/transport"&gt;Transport policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget-2013"&gt;Budget 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliette-garside"&gt;Juliette Garside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.3/22882?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=GUK%3AArticle%3Agoogle-driverless-cars-data-monday-note%3A1881843&amp;ch=Technology&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Google+%28Technology%29%2CMapping+technologies%2CTechnology%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CGoogle+Street+View+%28Technology%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CCorporate+IT&amp;c6=Frederic+Filloux&amp;c7=2013%2F03%2F18+01%3A48&amp;c8=1881843&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Blogpost%2CComment%2CNews&amp;c13=Monday+Note+%28series%29&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c47=UK&amp;c65=Data+in+the+driver%27s+seat&amp;c66=News&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FNews%2FTechnology%2FGoogle" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Autonomous vehicles – fully or partially – will rely on a large variety of data types. And guess who is best positioned to take advantage of this enormous new business? Yep, Google is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Google driverless car is an extraordinary technical achievement. &lt;/strong&gt;To grasp the its scope, watch &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/cdgQpa1pUUE"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; featuring a near-blind man sitting behind the wheel of an autonomous Prius as the car does the driving. Or, to get an idea of the complexity of the system, see &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/YXylqtEQ0tk"&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt; by Sebastian Thrun (one of the main architects of Google's self-driving car project) going through the multiple systems running inside the car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spectacular as it is, this public demonstration is merely the tip of the iceberg. For Google, the economics of self-driving cars lie in a vast web of data that will become a must to operate partially or fully self-driving vehicles on a massive scale. This network of data will require immense computational and storage capabilities. Consider the following needs in the context of Google's current position in related fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps.&lt;/strong&gt; Since the acquisition of Where2 Technologies and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole,_Inc"&gt;Keyhole Inc.&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, Google has been refining its mapping system over and over again (see this &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/helloworld/behind/history.html"&gt;brief history of Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a decade of work, Google Maps feature a rich set of layers and functions. Their mapping of the world has been supplemented by crowdsourcing systems that allow corrections as well as the creation of city maps where data does not exist. Street View was launched in 2007 and more than 5m miles of metropolitan area have been covered. Today, maps are augmented with satellite imagery, 3D, 45-degree aerial views, buildings and infrastructure renderings. All this is now merged, you can plunge from a satellite view to the street level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's goal is building the most complete and reliable map system in the world. Gradually, the company replaces geo-data from third-party suppliers with data collected by its own crews around the world. To get an idea of how fast Google progresses, consider the following: In 2008, Google mapping covered 22 countries and offered 13m miles with driving directions. In 2012, 187 countries where covered, 26m miles with driving directions, including 29 countries with turn-by-turn directions. On the chart below, you can also see the growing areas of Google-sourced maps (in green) as opposed to licensed data (in red):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/google-world.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-5382" title="google world" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/google-world-1024x524.png" alt="" width="430" height="220" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's failure in maps shows that, regardless of the amount of money invested, experience remains a key element. In California and India, Google maintains a staff of hundreds if not thousands of people manually checking key spots in large metropolitan areas and correcting errors. They rely on users whose individual suggestions are manually checked, using Street View imagery as shown here (the operator drags the 360° Street View image to verify signs at an intersection – click to enlarge.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/street-view-correction.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-5385" title="street view correction" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/street-view-correction-1024x581.png" alt="" width="430" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's engineers even developed algorithms aimed at correcting slight misalignments between "tiles" (pieces of satellite imagery stitched together) that could result from … tectonic plates movement – it could happen when two pictures are taken two years apart. Such accuracy is not a prerequisite for current navigation, but it could be important for autonomous cars that will depend heavily on ultra-precise (think what centimetres/inches mean when cars are close on the road) mapping of streets and infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, one might object, Google is not the only company providing geo-data and great mapping services. True: The Dutch company &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomTom"&gt;Tom-tom&lt;/a&gt;, or the Chicago-based &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomTom"&gt;Navteq&lt;/a&gt; have been doing this for years. As geo-data became strategically important, Tom-tom acquired TeleAtlas for $2.9bn (£1.9bn) in 2008, and Nokia bought Navteq in 2007. But Google intends to move one step ahead by merging its mapping and imagery technologies with its search capabilities. Like in this image:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/street-view-labels.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-5386" title="street view labels" src="http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/street-view-labels-1024x490.png" alt="" width="430" height="206" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurate, usable and data-rich maps are one thing. Now, when you consider the variety of data needed for autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, the task becomes even more enormous. The list goes on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic conditions will be a key element.&lt;/strong&gt; It's pointless to envision fleets of self-driving, or assisted-driving cars without systems to manage traffic. These goes along with infrastructure development. For instance, as &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pGvEMRwAAAAJ&amp;hI=en"&gt;Dr. Kara Kockelman&lt;/a&gt;, professor of transportation engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, explained to me, in the future, we might see substantial infrastructure renovation aimed at accommodating autonomous vehicles (or vehicles set on self-driving mode). Dedicated highway corridors would be allocated to "platoons" of cars driving close together, in a faster and safer way, than manned cars. Intersections, she said, are also a key challenge as they are responsible for most traffic jams (and a quarter of accidents). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the advent of autonomous vehicles, we can see cars taken over by intersection management systems that will regroup them in platoons and feed them seamlessly in intersecting traffic flows, like in this &lt;a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~aim/"&gt;spectacular simulation&lt;/a&gt;. If traffic lights are still needed, they will change every five or six seconds just to optimise the flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applied to millions of vehicles, traffic and infrastructure management will turn into a gigantic data and communication problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, Google might be the only entity able to write the required software and to deploy the data centres to run it. Its millions of servers will be of great use to handle weather information, road conditions (as cars might be able to monitor their actual friction on the road and transmit the data to following vehicles, or detect humidity and temperature change), parking data and fuel availability (petrol or electricity). And we can even think of merging all this with day-to-day life elements such as individual calendars, commuting patterns and geolocating people through their cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the data collection and crunching tasks can conceivably be handled by a Google-like player, communications remain an issue. "There is not enough overlap between car-to-car communication and in other fields", &lt;a href="http://engineering.stanford.edu/profile/beiker"&gt;Sven Beiker&lt;/a&gt;, director Center for Automotive Research at Stanford (CARS) told me (see his recent lecture about &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEsCMHXiDlE"&gt;The Future of the Car&lt;/a&gt;). He is actually echoing executives from Audi (who made a &lt;a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.fr/2013/01/google-audi-enhancing-navigation.html"&gt;strategic deal&lt;/a&gt; with Google), BMW and Ford; together at the Mobile World Congress, they were critical of cell-phone carriers' inability to provide the right 4G (LTE) infrastructure to handle the amount of data required by future vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, there is the question of an operating system for cars.&lt;/strong&gt; Experts are divided. Beiker believes the development of self-driving vehicles will depend more on communication protocols than on an OS &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. Others believe that Google, with its fleet of self-driving Priuses criss-crossing California, is building the first OS dedicated to autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, the search giant could combine its mapping, imagery and local search capabilities with the accumulation of countless self-driven miles, along with scores of specific situations "learned" by the cars' software. The value thus created would be huge, giving Google a decisive position in yet another field. The search company could become the main provider of both systems and data for autonomous or semi autonomous cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:frederic.filloux@mondaynote.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;frederic.filloux@mondaynote.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mapping-technologies"&gt;Mapping technologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing"&gt;Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google-street-view"&gt;Google Street View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/frederic-filloux"&gt;Frédéric Filloux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

These include intact pottery, the ship's anchor and some puzzling bronze objects. The team believes that hundreds more items could be buried in the sediment nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Antikythera wreck, which dates from the first century BC, yielded a glittering haul when sponge divers discovered it at the beginning of the 20th century. Among jewellery, weapons and statues were the remains of a mysterious clockwork device, dubbed the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2008/dec/11/antikythera-first-computer" title=""&gt;Antikythera mechanism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bar a brief visit by the undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau in the 1970s (featured in his documentary &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Cousteau-Odyssey-Diving-Plunder/dp/B000MQC62W" title=""&gt;Diving for Roman Plunder&lt;/a&gt;), no one had visited the wreck since, leading to speculation about what treasures might still be down there. The locals told tales of giant marble statues lying beyond the sponge divers' reach, while ancient technology geeks like me wondered whether the site might be hiding another Antikythera mechanism, or at least some clues as to whom this mysterious object belonged to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cue all-round excitement when in October last year, a team of divers led by &lt;a href="http://www.whoi.edu/hpb/Site.do?id=452" title=""&gt;Brendan Foley&lt;/a&gt; of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Aggeliki Simossi of Greece's Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, went back for a proper look. The divers used James Bond-style propulsion vehicles equipped with high-resolution video cameras &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/oct/02/return-antikythera-wreck-ancient-computer" title=""&gt;to circumnavigate the island at about 40 metres depth&lt;/a&gt;. Now the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/gallery/2013/mar/18/antikythera-shipwreck-treasures-in-pictures" title=""&gt;photos released by the team&lt;/a&gt; show some of what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries Antikythera was in a busy shipping lane, but surprisingly its treacherous underwater cliffs and reefs are not littered with sunken ships (perhaps those ancient navigators were more skilled than we thought). And there are no obvious signs of a wreck at the site supposedly excavated by Cousteau, suggesting that he recovered all of the visible items there – or that he planted some of his finds for the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 200 metres away, the divers found artefacts spread across the rocky sea floor, on a steep slope between 35 and 60 metres deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest item recovered was a huge lead anchor stock. It was lying on a semicircular object that might be a scupper pipe, used to drain water from the ship's deck. If so, the ship may have gone down as she was sailing with the anchor stowed. The team also raised an intact storage jar (amphora), which matches those previously recovered from the wreck. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111014/full/news.2011.594.html" title=""&gt;DNA tests&lt;/a&gt; may reveal its original contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most intriguing are dozens of irregular spherical objects sprinkled across the wreck site. They look like rocks but contain flecks of green, suggesting small bronze fragments, corroded and encrusted in sediment after thousands of years in the sea. This is just what the Antikythera mechanism looked like when it was discovered. Then again, they could be collections of ship's nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the artefacts the team found are a short distance from the site investigated by Cousteau, it's possible that they belong to a second ship from around the same date as the original wreck, perhaps part of the same fleet. But Foley thinks it more likely that all of the remains come from one vessel that broke up as it sank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm this, he hopes to revisit the site later this year. He wants to use metal detectors to map the distribution of metal and ceramic objects buried beneath the surface, as well as dig a few test trenches. "I'm intensely curious about what's in the sediments," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cousteau only excavated a few square metres of the site but that was enough to reveal more than two hundred items, including jewellery, coins and small bronze statues. But while previous visits to the wreck have been little more than salvage expeditions, Foley says he'd love to carry out a systematic, scientific excavation of the wreck site, if he can find anyone to sponsor him: "As soon as we have the money we'll be back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jomarchant.com" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jo Marchant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is author of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://jomarchant.com/decoding-the-heavens-solving-the-mystery-of-the-worlds-first-computer" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoding the Heavens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a book about the Antikythera mechanism.

Now there's an app for that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id609019118?mt=8"&gt;Snoop Lion's Reincarnated: Track Notes App&lt;/a&gt; is a free download for iPad, released by digital publishing startup &lt;a href="http://citia.com/"&gt;Citia&lt;/a&gt;, which has previously launched apps based on books by Kevin Kelly, John Maxwell and Dan Ariely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snoop Lion app is the company's first venture into music, and the latest attempt to find a digital replacement for the liner notes and artwork from vinyl and CD albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you get isn't just the music – it's ABOUT the music," explains its App Store listing. "Where it came from, How it was made, WHY it was made. It's liner notes for the 21st century. Multimedia, multi-sensory, made for the fans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At launch, three full audio tracks are included in the app, each with its own lyric video, quotes from producers and collaborators, and information on the reggae songs that inspired them – complete with links to buy them on Apple's iTunes Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app also promotes Snoop Lion merchandise – t-shirts, "grindtainers" and a comfortable-looking pair of branded slippers, all sold from his Facebook store – as well as providing information on his &lt;a href="http://mindgardens.org/"&gt;Mind Gardens&lt;/a&gt; charity in Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music and videos are streamed from YouTube, with fans encouraged to register their details to be told when the "full app" is available after the album goes on sale. A purchase will presumably be involved then, either of music within the app, or from the iTunes Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using the app this morning, and it's interesting, fleshing out the backstory of Snoop's reinvention, and providing lots of useful recommendations for any of his fans who are dipping their toes (slippered or otherwise) into the reggae genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's just the latest example of a musician or label experimenting with apps as an album replacement or companion – this falls more into the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in March, pop duo Hurts took a different path, working with digital agency FOAM on &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hurts-exile/id614755877?mt=8"&gt;an audio-only iPhone game&lt;/a&gt;, soundtracked by songs from their latest album Exile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a recent Philip Glass remix album spawned an iOS "interactive visualisations" app called &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id577990725?mt=8"&gt;REWORK_ (Philip Glass Remixed)&lt;/a&gt;, developed by Scott Snibbe Studio – the agency that had a pivotal role in Bjork's Biophilia album-app project in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snoop Lion app's "liner notes for the 21st century" pitch corresponds with something Scott Snibbe &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/oct/21/scott-snibbe-bjork-biophilia-app"&gt;told The Guardian in an interview back in 2011&lt;/a&gt; about how apps might attempt to recapture the "falling in love" nature of listening to vinyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'd often sit on the carpet and let the whole thing wash over you while looking at the liner notes and artwork: it was a complete, immersive, sensory experience," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-sensory, as Citia puts it today. Liner notes, of course, were also something Apple was trying to revive with its iTunes LP format in iTunes, although it's not been hugely popular with labels or music fans – and has notably not yet been ported to Apple's iPad or iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Gaga is promising a plethora of bells and whistles in an app for her upcoming ARTPOP album, &lt;a href="https://littlemonsters.com/text/5047d491ac460c3508001b8e"&gt;telling fans in September 2012&lt;/a&gt; that "The most major way to fully immerse yourself in ARTPOP is through the APP… completely interactive with chats, films for every song, extra music, content, gaga inspired games, fashion updates, magazines, and more still in the works".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaga is promising to "upload new things to the APP all the time", which raises the possibility of an album as something that evolves over time, and which fans might even pay for with a monthly subscription. Even if she eschews that option, if ARTPOP is a hit, it may spur even more experimentation by artists and labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still mileage in albums as apps, or apps as companions for albums then. But the jury remains out on how meaningful they'll be for artists and the music industry compared to the wider disruption being wrought by the growth of streaming services like Spotify and Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here too, apps have a role to play. Nick Cave's new album is accompanied by &lt;a href="http://open.spotify.com/app/nickcave"&gt;an HTML5 app running in Spotify's desktop software&lt;/a&gt; helping fans dig into his back catalogue by theme, and it joins other apps for One Direction, David Guetta, Blur and Tiesto on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Spotify's Scandinavian heartland, EMI's Nordic division has &lt;a href="http://musically.com/2013/02/14/emi-nordic-launches-spotify-powered-mobile-apps-for-artists/"&gt;released iPhone apps for five artists&lt;/a&gt; that enable fans to stream their albums in full from Spotify within those apps – in contrast to the Snoop Lion app's focus on iTunes downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snoop Dogg may be reinventing himself musically, but the music industry continues to go through its own digital rebirthing process, where a few huge revenue streams are replaced by a patchwork of digital, physical, live and licensing income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Album apps aren't a simple, lucrative replacement for declining CD sales, but they're part of the industry's own reincarnation as a 21st century business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/snoopdogg"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apps"&gt;Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipad"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/tablet-computer"&gt;Tablet computers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/musicindustry"&gt;Music industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media"&gt;Digital media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuart-dredge"&gt;Stuart Dredge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Interactive filmmaker Chris Milk on the new frontier of the web</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2013/mar/18/chris-milk-html5-arcade-fire</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.3/80862?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=GUK%3AArticle%3Achris-milk-html5-arcade-fire%3A1881224&amp;ch=Technology&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Technology%2CMedia%2CHTML5%2CArcade+Fire%2CInternet%2CDigital+music+and+audio+%28Technology%29%2CDigital+media%2CGoogle+%28Technology%29%2CBeck+%28musician%29&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CIndie%2CDigital+Media%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CMedia+Weekly%2CTechnology+Gadgets%2CCorporate+IT&amp;c6=Jemima+Kiss&amp;c7=2013%2F03%2F18+11%3A11&amp;c8=1881224&amp;c9=Blog&amp;c10=Blogpost&amp;c13=&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c25=Technology+blog&amp;c47=UK&amp;c65=Chris+Milk%2C+interactive+filmmaker%2C+on+the+new+frontier+of+the+web&amp;c66=News&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FNews%2FTechnology%2FHTML5" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;The filmmaker behind Arcade Fire's Wilderness Downtown project explains the thrill of interactivity, and why even the techiest project has to start with a story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heartbreak weighs particularly heavy on the fragile teenage heart. The drama of those first experiences of love never seem that long ago, so all-consuming, and followed by a rejection that seems to define the world, until the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was 17, and going out with a girl I found out was cheating on me," &lt;a href="http://portfolio.chrismilk.com"&gt;Chris Milk&lt;/a&gt; recalls, leaning back on a black leather couch. "I ran home from her house so angry, and in the dark. By the time I got home the sun was coming up, but the sound of that running, and the feeling of going back to my house triggered the beginning of a concept ..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/xChrisMilk?feature=watch"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; is a filmmaker, and latterly one seduced by the possibilities of the internet – a medium most filmmakers seem to shy away from. Approached by Google's &lt;a href="http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work.html"&gt;Aaron Koblin&lt;/a&gt;, creative director of the data arts team, Milk had his interest piqued by some of the &lt;a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com"&gt;Chrome experiments&lt;/a&gt; being promoted by Google. &lt;a href="http://www.arcadefire.com"&gt;Arcade Fire&lt;/a&gt; have an impressive roster of interactives on their discography, including several projects with Canadian Vincent Morisset; &lt;a href="http://www.beonlineb.com"&gt;Neon Bible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sprawl2.com"&gt;Sprawl II&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.aatoaa.com/#syncart"&gt;synchronised artwork&lt;/a&gt; project Morisset made for The Suburbs album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk started talking to Arcade Fire, who shared unfinished songs while working on the album The Suburbs and sent him We Used to Wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish I could tell you there was some great piece of art that was the inspiration for it, but I basically listened to the song a thousand times to see what came to mind. In this case, it was a dreamscape from my own life, of footsteps, and the rhythm that sounded to me like running. I'd been exploring my own house recently on Street View and it reminded me of that moment with the girl I'd been seeing when I was 17, so I built on top of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This became the &lt;a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com"&gt;Wilderness Downtown&lt;/a&gt; project, which set something of a high bar for the mainstream music video scene when it was released in 2010, given the poor state of both technology and imagination in most commercial music videos. Openness to experimenting with technology has an obstacle with adequate funding, despite an obvious creative curiosity in what is possible. "I knew a bit about the capabilities of HTML5 and have always had a preoccupation with technology. I wanted to delve deeper, to see what else it could do. The technology becomes the palette that you make the artwork with, your palette and your paint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I was adamant the project had to tell a story or have an emotional core. It has to start with the human, emotional place, because if you start with the tech, you're basically building a tech demo. Music is a great catalyst for emotion because it gets to your core."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Arcade Fire, Milk produced the &lt;a href="http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com"&gt;Johnny Cash Project&lt;/a&gt;, aggregating single frames from thousands of fans to create one, mesmerising crowdsourced animation; again, a project built with &lt;a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/multimedia"&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His latest project rolled out on 10 February, but Milk carried on tweaking it online for three weeks. The concept for &lt;a href="http://www.hello-again.com/beck360/flash_detect"&gt;Beck's cover of Sound and Vision&lt;/a&gt; started with the music – a deconstructed, reimagined interpretation of David Bowie's 1977 classic, with the help of 170 musicians, singers, a theremin and saw player, brass band and string orchestra, among others. Beck, with Milk, set the team up in a vast LA studio with 360-degree cameras, creating a &lt;a href="http://www.hello-again.com/beck360/flash_detect"&gt;Flash-based interactive&lt;/a&gt; that lets the online viewer navigate around the studio – and the sound – accordingly. The viewer controls what they see by moving left, right, up and down in front of their webcam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk said that like many online projects, the iteration continues after release, tweaking and adding features including alternative lenses for the viewer's camera. "Web projects aren't done until I'm happy, or someone changes the password to the server. A formal release does not stop me from working on it more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All this is a world away from the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mtv"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; music video days of the early nougthies; the station, which defined much of popular culture until the mainstream internet, played around eight hours of music videos a day in the year 2000, but by 2008 that had dropped to 2008. Much of the existing music video space seems unimaginative, battling a perceived problem returning that investment that has led to reduced budgets and crude product placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the film-maker with an open mind, the attraction is an equally open-ended medium, with no established construct. "There hasn't been an entirely new medium to make art in, a medium that is really fluid, and we have to find ways to challenge that medium," said Milk. It's a space that evolved so quickly that there are things he couldn't do with the Johnny Cash project, but could do six months later with Wilderness Downtown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's really exciting as a person who wants to make work that speaks to people, because from a storytelling standpoint, we don't know what that construct will look like. Cinema has evolved to a three-act structure, music soundtracks, close ups and colour and abstracts – but that wasn't there at the beginning, so I'm interested to see how this medium evolves for storytelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a point, he says, akin to the train coming through the cinema screen of the 1920's. "In 100 years, they will look at Facebook in the same way. 'Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; it's a 12-act narrative structure with polygrams and line tags …' so the interactive space is a way to experiment with storytelling and portraying emotions."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MTV, a one-directional feed for music videos, gave way to the interactivity of YouTube – yet most production still approaches the music video as if it is being broadcast and distributed through traditional TV, said Milk. It's the oft-referenced paradigm shift for yet another industry disrupted by web technology, but what if the filmmaker was to accept that the internet medium, and the two-way interaction, is dominant, and that music videos will never play out through TV again? He says the same is true for newspapers, which have an opportunity to reimagine and enhance their storytelling around a contextualised experience for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's then not only a conversation, but you can reference everything on the internet," explains Milk of the exquisite insight at the heart of Wilderness Downtown. "With Street View, you're curating a data set capable of incredible emotional resonance for the person interacting with it because everyone grew up somewhere. And if your house is in this dataset, that's going to provide some emotional context for you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the ubiquity and simplicity of Street View that made Wilderness Downtown work, suggesting part of the story, but letting the viewer's own memories do the rest. Much of the web's universal content, like Facebook photos, are too diverse to repeat the trick, with too little continuity to create a story around it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more ideas taking shape in the world of Chris Milk. He's looking for funding for the feature film Bitterroot, about a Montana rancher who sets out to avenge a telemarketing scheme that robs him of his savings. Nick Nolte is rumoured for the project, which manages to weave a very American rural nostalgia for a family business with revenge against bankers, Walmart and, finally, a reconciliation with his estranged son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's also quietly nursing a curious &lt;a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-the-bride-stripped-bare-by-her-bachelors-even-the-large-glass-t02011"&gt;Duchamp&lt;/a&gt;-esque project known as the &lt;a href="http://portfolio.chrismilk.com/wilderness-machine"&gt;Wilderness Machine&lt;/a&gt;. This physical extension of Wilderness Downtown invites viewers to write a message to their younger self, which a mechanical pen transcribes onto a real postcard embedded with birch seeds, ready to be planted in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if Wilderness Downtown keeps ticking over for a few more years, we might see those same birch trees on the verges inside Google Street Viewn ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkovjr/5023771453/" title="The porch by selkovjr, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4090/5023771453_9a3e5b26de.jpg" width="460" alt="The porch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/selkovjr/5023771453/"&gt;selkovjr&lt;/a&gt; on Flickr. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en_GB"&gt;Some rights reserved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/html5"&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/arcadefire"&gt;Arcade Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/digital-music-and-audio"&gt;Digital music and audio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media"&gt;Digital media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/beck"&gt;Beck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jemimakiss"&gt;Jemima Kiss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Sharents to Bio-facture: buzzwords for the future</title>

Trend forecasting agency &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thefuturelaboratory.com/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Future Laboratory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; recently revealed a number of buzzwords to&amp;nbsp;reflect the state of tomorrow. Here are a choice few:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Sharents&lt;/strong&gt; Those annoying adults who tweet their offspring's every utterance and can't go a day without uploading another "adorable" photo. As a result of such parental pride, it will become unusual for children to reach secondary school without an online history that can be traced back to the day they were born. Thanks, Mum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Child Technology Officers &lt;/strong&gt;Does your child know more than you do about your mobile phone? Have you sheepishly sought their advice on how to use Vine or Pinterest? The next 10 years will see the rise of Child Technology Officers – the pint-sized family authorities on everything digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Screenagers&lt;/strong&gt; Worried about your children watching too much TV? How quaint. Future Laboratory's research showed that today's under-10s see no difference between their on- and offline lives. "Child technology officers" will grow into "screenagers" whose realities are as much on screen as in classrooms and homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Pretail &lt;/strong&gt; Where brands follow our online footprints to tell us what we want before we even know we want it. On one hand, this is simply a development of a truth that successful businesses have always known; on the other, it's an unnerving glimpse into an increasingly Orwellian future. See &lt;a href="http://www.expectlabs.com/mindmeld/" title=""&gt;MindMeld&lt;/a&gt;, an app that "listens in" to your online conversations, then offers relevant products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Space-vertising&lt;/strong&gt; As passenger space travel becomes a reality (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2012/jun/17/space-tourism-science-virgin-robin-mckie" title=""&gt;Virgin is set to launch its first flights soon&lt;/a&gt;), expect to see other big brands vying for a piece of the intergalactic action. Already, vodka brand Stolichnaya has sent a mixologist to shake a zero-gravity cocktail and Nestle has floated a KitKat in the stratosphere. Why? Why not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Bio-facture&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers at Scotland's Heriot-Watt University have discovered a 3D printing technique that uses embryonic stem cells to create human tissue while students at London's Central St Martins are looking into the possibility of a GM strawberry plant that can grow lace from its roots, thus combining food and textile production. The convergence of technology and biology should lead to a more sustainable future. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting"&gt;Parents and parenting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/social-media"&gt;Social media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/3d-printing"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family"&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Benjamin Lasnier: Danish Justin Bieber lookalike, now with a record contract</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/shortcuts/2013/mar/18/danish-justin-bieber-record-contract</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.3/44123?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=GUK%3AArticle%3Adanish-justin-bieber-record-contract%3A1881216&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=G2&amp;c4=Justin+Bieber%2CInstagram%2CTechnology%2CMusic%2CDenmark+%28news%29%2CEurope+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Tim+Hume&amp;c7=2013%2F03%2F18+07%3A30&amp;c8=1881216&amp;c9=Blog&amp;c10=Feature%2CBlogpost&amp;c13=&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c25=Shortcuts&amp;c47=UK&amp;c65=Benjamin+Lasnier%3A+Danish+Justin+Bieber+lookalike%2C+now+with+a+record+contract&amp;c66=Culture&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FCulture%2FMusic%2FJustin+Bieber" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Twelve-year-old Benjamin Lasnier has more than 762,000 followers on Instagram. Now he wants to start a music career – and crack America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Easter, a 12-year-old Dane named &lt;a href="http://web.stagram.com/n/benjaminlasnier/" title=""&gt;Benjamin Lasnier&lt;/a&gt; was sitting in a restaurant when his cousin convinced him to join Instagram. He followed 10 friends and posted a self-portrait. Half an hour later, it had more than 50 "likes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasnier, a confident kid who some say resembles his idol Justin Bieber, sensed he had a certain currency on the site. He continued to post pictures – more than 2,100 so far, almost exclusively "selfies" – and people continued to like them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 762,000 followers, the now 13-year-old from Copenhagen is one of the world's most "Instagram famous" people, with a follower count dwarfing those of many celebrities (Jessie&amp;nbsp;J, for example, has 367,000). To hardcore fans – who identify&amp;nbsp;as "Benzilers", a clunky adaptation of Justin's "Beliebers" – he has the stature of an idol. "You are so beautiful! Not just on the outside, but the inside!" reads one 11-year-old's comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasnier has hustled to turn the attention into something tangible. He began posting 12 pictures a day, at optimal times for different time zones. Each &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;attracts 60,000-odd "likes", propelling it on to Instagram's "popular" page, where it is visible to the site's 100 million users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through images alone, he has fine-tuned a brand that is catnip to tweens: non-threatening, motivational and completely unattainable (he follows fewer than 1,000 people). The formula works so well that 42,000 people follow an &lt;a href="http://web.stagram.com/n/batmanlasnier/" title=""&gt;account for his dog&lt;/a&gt;. Brands shower him with products in the hope he will be photographed with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasnier's mother, Merete, became aware something was happening in October, when he started being mobbed by girls in public. She supports his ambition, despite the abusive comments, which, she says, he is wise enough to ignore. And, unlike the sexualised "selfies" of some of his young followers, his photos are uniformly chaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a musical background limited to YouTube lip-synchs, Lasnier – who made himself an idol without pretending to any talent at all – is now signed to Sony, working with top producers to crack America. But is there more to him than just a pretty&amp;nbsp;face?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every talent starts from scratch," says Sony A&amp;R Mads Kjaergaard. If Lasnier can credibly establish himself and leverage his fanbase "there is no limit to where he could go".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it will require losing the "Instagram boy" moniker, and to that end, Lasnier is already attempting a rebrand, limiting the selfies to four a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People say: 'He takes too many pictures of himself, he (must have a) big ego,' and it's not what I want," he says. "I'm ready to go another way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was amended on Monday 18 March at 10.35. In the original headline, Benjamin Lasnier's name was spelt incorrectly. This has been amended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/justin-bieber"&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/instagram"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

How was your weekend? More Far Cry 3 for me. I spent &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; planning a subtle, stealthy raid on a pirate outpost and just as I was about to start, a pack of dingos ran into the enclosure – the pirates started throwing fire bombs, killing three of their own number in the process. I just walked in, switched the alarm off and finished the rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/games"&gt;Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/keithstuart"&gt;Keith Stuart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

However, I was unable to credit either card to my account, receiving a message each time that: "the iTunes giftcard you entered has already been redeemed".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I emailed iTunes support and was informed that one card had been redeemed on 31 December 2011 and the other on 2&amp;nbsp;January 2012. Both had been in my possession with the scratch-off surface over the code still intact. They should also not have expired, as I complied with the criteria that there had to have been activity on my account in the last two years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On further investigation, Apple told me that the gift cards were redeemed in Sainsbury's and that the supermarket may have issued the same ones I had on a later date. Apple refused to reissue me with two other £25 cards, saying it isn't responsible for this kind of loss. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, as the issue of duplicate redemption is not my fault, I don't see why I should be penalised. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AB,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isle of Wight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went back and forth with Apple on this. Initially it said that it was possible cashier error could lead to different cards being activated using the same code and, if this had happened, then your statutory rights lie with the vendor rather than wholesaler. In other words, it put the ball firmly in Sainsbury's court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, after discussions with Sainsbury's, Apple backtracked, saying it was unlikely to be cashier error because the activation code is swiped and not typed in. Apple went away for discussions with its "tech guys in the US" but came back with nothing, eventually concluding it had no idea what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked if was possible to purchase giftcards with the same redemption details on them and it told us categorically no. All it could say was that the gift cards were redeemed on different iTunes accounts on 31 December 2011 and 2 January 2012, but could not tell us any details of how or by whom, because to do so would be "a breach of its privacy policy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple said it would refund you as a gesture of goodwill if you had the original receipts, but of course you don't as the cards were given to you some time back. It does not seem to want to accept your untampered-with cards as proof you haven't spent them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Sainsbury's has come good and offered to refund you the £50 as a gesture of goodwill. You say you are "extremely grateful to Sainsburys for their very generous offer and demonstration of excellent customer care" and much less impressed with Apple, whom you say you will not spend any more money with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:consumer.champions@guardian.co.uk" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;consumer.champions@guardian.co.uk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or write to Bachelor &amp; Brignall, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

I formed habits around mobility that I can't really imagine going away from. The first few weeks [of going mobile-only] were definitely tough, but everything's changing and moving at such a fast pace, the capabilities are expanding so fast, I can't imagine going back to a PC as my primary device."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most important, he became accustomed to getting results for his customers quickly, without ever having to make excuses. "I was never in a situation where I said 'I'll get back to you when I get back to office' .... That's gone from my lexicon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early days were a challenge, though. For him, the hardest thing was getting used to the lack of an accessible file system. He advises anybody considering following his path to think really hard about where you're going to store files and how you're going to move big files around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I ended up relying heavily on Box and Dropbox," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He used a Samsung Galaxy Note. The "CITE" of CITEworld stands for "Consumerisation of IT in the Enterprise. (Thanks @rubbernuke for the pointer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.yankeegroup.com/ygapp/content/692006eabb884da2bdccd02907cb1f1b/50/mobilenow/"&gt;Samsung unveils new Galaxy S IV phone &gt;&gt; Yankee Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Howe: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Samsung were Apple, it would have named this design the Galaxy S IIIS. While Samsung updated the internals and the software, the S IV is just another iteration on the Galaxy design to be slightly bigger, faster and with a few new apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We fully expect the Galaxy S IV to be an excellent flagship phone for Samsung, but Yankee Group doesn't see the S IV allowing Samsung to gain ground against Apple in the crucial U.S. market. According to Yankee Group's 2013 U.S. Consumer Survey, March, only about 15% of consumers intend to buy a Samsung phone within the next six months, while 40% intend to buy Apple iPhones within that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brand called "Don't Know", meanwhile, has great brand recognition and is a likely next buy for many. And: just wait for Samsung to start an advertising blitz in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://inessential.com/2013/03/15/what_else_google_is_shutting_down"&gt;What else Google is shutting down &gt;&gt; inessential.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent Simmons (who wrote one of the great RSS readers, NetNewsWire): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the demise of Google Reader got all the attention, there are some other things going away in A second spring of cleaning. It's worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting ones: the CalDAV API will be removed for all but whitelisted developers. CalDAV builds on WebDAV and is an open standard. Instead you'd have to use the Google Calendar API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't have noticed this except that I was out with two calendar developers last night: John Chaffee of BusyCal and Michael Simmons of Flexibits. I suspect they've got some coding to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google certainly has the right to shut things down — and I think they're right to do so, also. The company's been all over the place and should continue to work on focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don't like when they turn off existing support for an open standard like CalDAV in favor of a Google-only API. Sure, they can — it's within their rights, obviously. But I don't like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To those who think Google has a commitment to free and open source: get real. That only applies when it will commoditise a rival's paid-for products to zero price and so destroy them. (This change also, by the way, screws Windows Phone users, who already face challenges over the end of Exchange functionality from Gmail.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tealeafnation.com/2013/03/prominent-weibo-users-paid-to-bash-apple-introducing-chinas-820-party/"&gt;Prominent Weibo users paid to bash Apple? Introducing China's '820 Party' &gt;&gt; Tea Leaf Nation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, CCTV, China' state-run television network, &lt;a href="http://www.tealeafnation.com/2013/03/chinese-state-television-goes-after-apple-inc-web-users-call-for-boycott/"&gt;ran an expose on Apple&lt;/a&gt;, generating to an outcry against the company on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. News quickly broke, however, that CCTV had paid celebrities to post anti-Apple remarks. A slip up on the part of Peter Ho, a Taiwanese-American movie star and spokesperson for Samsung Galaxy, provided a glimpse behind the scenes. He &lt;a href="http://lady.163.com/13/0315/23/8Q1UVSN600264M4F.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#315isLive# Wow, Apple has so many tricks in its after-sales services. As an Apple fan, I'm hurt. You think this would be acceptable to Steve Jobs? Or to those young people who sold their kidneys [to buy iPads]? It's really true that big chains treat customers poorly. &lt;strong&gt;Post around 8:20&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ho was later updated his Weibo with a post &lt;a href="http://www.weibo.com/1194869670/znAZu9Jtn"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; his phone had been stolen and that he hasn't posted the previous message, but Weibo users had already noticed that he failed to delete the last sentence of the offending tweet, his instructions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://pinterest.com/googlegraveyard/pins/"&gt;GoogleGraveyard (googlegraveyard) &gt;&gt; Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collated by Frank Shaw, Microsoft's PR, this is nevertheless true. (We linked to it previously in July 2012.) The total is now 44 items - the latest to hit the dust being Google Reader. However, more are coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/03/16/what-can-be-learned-when-sharing-leads-to-failing/"&gt;What can be learned when sharing leads to failing &gt;&gt; PandoDaily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Berk with four very basic, but often overlooked, lessons for any tech startup - in fact, any business, but tech startups have a habit of trying to solve the wrong problems first ("what should our domain name be?").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/03/15/apples-galaxy-challenge-in-three-easy-charts/"&gt;Apple's Galaxy challenge in three easy charts &gt;&gt; Barrons.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Tavis] McCourt [of brokers Raymond James], who has an Outperform rating on Apple shares and a $600 price target, confines himself to the simple observation that "iPhone shipments since 2010 (when Samsung launched the Galaxy line) still dwarf Galaxy sales, but Samsung is closing the gap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCourt thinks Apple's iPhone again outsold Galaxy this quarter, but that the positions will reverse next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three choice charts from the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charts make interesting viewing, though as Apple doesn't break down iPhone sales between the 4, 4S and 5 (and the period shown includes a time when it was selling the 3GS too) and Samsung simply doesn't give any accountable figures for smartphone sales, you might want to take them with some salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/matthew-keys/2012/03/07/the-internetfeds-inside-hacker-sabus-war-room/"&gt;The InternetFeds: Inside hacker Sabu's war room &gt;&gt; Reuters.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Keys, writing in March 2012: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 20, 2010, a report by the PBS NewsHour exposed a document that contained dozens of government usernames and passwords. The document, which was published on the NewsHour website, was only known to InternetFeds. It became clear that someone among the ranks was a mole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paranoia swept through the room [of elite Anonymous hackers]. There were discussions of who the mole might be. A hacker named Switch was a popular guess. Some people thought it was me. (I &lt;a href="http://producermatthew.com/post/3943978239/statement-on-the-exposure-of-anonymous-hackers-by"&gt;later said&lt;/a&gt; I gave the documents to NewsHour.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other incidents took place that added to the paranoia. The website of New York's Green Party, which InternetFeds planned to attack in an "epic owning," was defaced without the approval of the room's members. An article on the &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/elvbq/looks_like_anonymous_has_gotten_into_the_la_times/"&gt;Los Angeles Times' website&lt;/a&gt; was defaced by a hacker, again without collective approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's significant about this is that Keys, who seems to have had access to the chatroom, is accused of being the person who gave login details to the hacker who defaced the LA Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.zite.com/2013/03/14/google-reader-is-dead-so-we-rebuilt-it-for-you-in-zite-in-six-hours/"&gt;Google Reader is dead, so we rebuilt it for you in Zite (in six hours) &gt;&gt; Zite's blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zite was able to pull this together so quickly because of how our backend works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Reader has always been part of Zite – users have always had the option of adding their Google Reader account to tell our personalization algorithms which sources they prefer and what types of stories they like to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zite ingests millions of articles each day from hundreds of thousands of sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zite has deep personalization technology that can analyze user reading habits and pick the best stories from their Google Reader instead of getting inundated with hundreds of articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a basic feed reading only. There are definitely some limitations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limitations schmitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/mobile-malcoders-pay-to-google-play/"&gt;Mobile malcoders pay to (Google) Play &gt;&gt; Krebs on Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Krebs: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An explosion in malware targeting Android users is being fueled in part by a budding market for mobile malcode creation kits, as well as a brisk market for hijacked or fraudulent developer accounts at Google Play that can be used to disguise malware as legitimate apps for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently encountered an Android malware developer on a semi-private Underweb forum who was actively buying up verified developer accounts at Google Play for $100 apiece. Google charges just $25 for Android developers who wish to sell their applications through the Google Play marketplace, but it also requires the accounts to be approved and tied to a specific domain. The buyer in this case is offering $100 for sellers willing to part with an active, verified Play account that  is tied to a dedicated server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, this particular entrepreneur also sells an Android SMS malware package that targets customers of Citibank, HSBC and ING, as well as 66 other financial institutions in Australia, France, India, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey (the complete list is &lt;a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PerkeleBanks.txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The targeted banks offer text messages as a form of multi-factor authentication, and this bot is designed to intercept all incoming SMS messages on infected Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grabbing SMSs stops you seeing two-factor authentication confirmations sent from your bank when a new transaction - by the malware - is initiated. (Look up Eurograbber: it's big business.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://jury.me/blog/2013/3/14/the-human-impact-of-bugs"&gt;The Human impact of bugs &gt;&gt; Jury.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-act play with software. Starts out very sad. Improves. Morality lesson in the middle/end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/google-reader-still-sends-far-more-traffic-than-google"&gt;Google Reader still drives far more traffic than Google+ &gt;&gt; Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data from the BuzzFeed Network, a set of tracked partner sites that collectively have over 300 million users, Google Reader is still a significant source of traffic for news — and a much larger one than Google+. The above chart, created by BuzzFeed's data team, represents data collected from August 2012 to today. (Yesterday, Google announced that it would close Reader in July.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should add that this data isn't complete. Google Reader traffic became much harder to measure last year when Google began defaulting users to SSL encryption in such a way that masked referral data. And this doesn't include data from apps that use Google Reader as a sync service, such as Reeder. In other words, it's likely that we're actually missing some Reader traffic here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the graph, the ratio looks like roughly 70:1 for Reader:G+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can follow &lt;a href="http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech"&gt;Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To suggest a link, either add it below or tag it with @gdntech on the free &lt;a href="http://www.delicious.com/"&gt;Delicious&lt;/a&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur"&gt;Charles Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josh-halliday"&gt;Josh Halliday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The public appetite for television is also such that we now record an estimated 455m hours, or the equivalent of almost 52,000 years of TV each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TeleScope study also includes the first ever "TeleHappiness Index" survey, which seeks to assess the public's emotional engagement with television. In the findings, which surveyed more than 1,000 people, comedy is the genre which brings most happiness to viewers' lives, with 95% of those surveyed saying they got most enjoyment from the genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also showed that 80% of people aged 65 or over found the most enjoyment in children's television, many of them watching with their grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than four fifths of people in Wales (82%) derive more happiness from watching sport than any other nation or region while 78% of viewers in the east of England are happier watching drama and soaps, more than everybody else, the report indicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tess Alps, chair of the commercial TV marketing group Thinkbox, said the findings indicated that TV had a rosy future. She said another reason for the continued popularity of television was the increase in the calibre and choice of homegrown TV as well as the availability of quality imports from the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the Guardian: "People used to worry about the fragmentation that resulted from digital TV expansion. But this just means that there is more choice. So while 15 million people watched Coronation Street 10 years ago now 10 million do, but those 5 million are still watching TV – Stella on Sky 1, maybe or Celebrity Juice on ITV2 – and one has to assume it's something they like even better. There is great choice now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pipa Doubtfire, TV Licensing's head of revenue management, said: "As live viewing still represents the majority of viewing for most people, technology is being used to complement – rather than replace - 'traditional' viewing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television"&gt;Television industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/tablet-computer"&gt;Tablet computers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing"&gt;Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/bendowell"&gt;Ben Dowell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
